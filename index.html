  Hello, World!<br>
  This website is a place for me to dump information about interests and hobbies. I plan to talk about areas of maths and physics that I have learnt throughout my undergraduate<br>
  particularly my summer project, my final dissertation, and new areas I will cover in the next year.<br>
  I also want to talk a bit about other interests.

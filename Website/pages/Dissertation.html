        <h1 class="title">Shape Memory Alloys</h1>
        <p>Shape memory alloys exhibit an effect whereby, after being deformed, and once sufficient heat is applied, they return to their original undeformed shape. Some shape memory alloys have another effect called super elasticity where any bends in the material are immediately reversed. <br>
        There are many applications such as for vibration dampers which are useful for noise reduction in aerospace engineering or for reducing the effects of earthquakes on buildings in civil engineering, another example is in flexible glasses frames and as a light-weight actuator in robotics. <br></p>
        <p>The effect is due to phase transitions between high-temperature austenite which has only one type of unit cell and low-temperature martensite which has many types of unit cells. The deformation gradients of which are called the variants. The larger number of variants in martensite corresponds to a breaking of the symmetry that the material enjoyed at higher temperatures. Nucleation causes these variants to collect into regions, that is it is energetically favourable to do so. Together these regions form a microstructure. <br></p>
        <p>This project covers the energy minimisation description of this phenomenon. The energy functional depends on the deformation gradient and the temperature, T:<br></p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}E[u, T] = \int_\Omega W(\nabla u(x), T)~dx\)
        <p>To minimise this functional, we note that the energy density, W, must be non-negative. As a result, by taking deformation gradients within the kernel of the energy density, we can minimise the energy density without needing to know the exact form of W. <br>
        One thing we will assume about the energy density is that it is invariant both under a change of frames and under symmetries of the crystal lattice. This will give a multi-well form of the kernel which is used to describe the shape memory effect.</p>

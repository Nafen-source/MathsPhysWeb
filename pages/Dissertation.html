        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side-flex">
          <p style="padding: 0px 0px 15px 15px;">Shape memory alloys (SMAs) exhibit an affect whereby, after being deformed, and once sufficient heat is applied, they return to their original undeformed shape. Some shape memory alloys have another effect called super elasticity where any bends in the material are immediately reverted. <br>
          Beyond their interest to material scientists [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01349a004">1</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642504000647">2</a>], there are many applications in engineering such as for vibration dampers which are useful for noise reduction in aerospace engineering or for reducing the effects of earthquakes on buildings in civil engineering 
          [<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1243/09544100JAERO211">3</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59768-8_4">4</a>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/14/22/6987">5</a>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/5/1723">6</a>];
          for flexible glasses frames; and for light-weight actuators in robotics [<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20217-9_18">7</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1729881419886747">8</a>]. <br>
          We however will stick to looking at the mathematics that goes into modelling these materials.</p>
          <img style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px; bottom: 50px; border: gray solid 2px; box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" src="../Graphics/Transition.png">

        <p style="position: relative; bottom: 60px;">Above is an image of the cubic-orthorhombic transition in CuAlNi which was taken by Hanuš Seiner [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002076831100103X">9</a>] using optical microscopy. Note the inhomogeneous behaviour - the material on the left side is flat while the right side has an oscillatory pattern.
        There are many other types of SMAs including Indium-Thallium, Nickel-Aluminium (which are cubic-tetragonal transitions modelled mathematically as will be seen later), Nickel-Titanium (or "Nitinol" which is a cubic-monoclinic transition), and even the fictional <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Wapometal">Wapometal</a> from One Piece!</p>
        
        <div class="side-by-side-flex">
          <img style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 50%; height: auto; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px; bottom: 30px; border: gray solid 2px; box-shadow: 0px 8px 16px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" src="../Graphics/UnitCells.png">
          <p style="padding: 0px 15px 15px 15px;">In solid materials, atoms are arranged into a <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~sangals/crystosim/crystaltut.html">crystal lattice</a>, with the unit cells of this lattice taking on many forms. Core to the shape memory effect (SME) is a solid-solid transition from the <b>austenitic phase</b>
            (one type of unit cell) above a critical temperature to the <b>martensitic phase</b> (many types of unit cell) below a critical temperature (the image on the right shows the unit cells in the cubic-tetragonal transition).
            The larger number of variants of the unit cell of martensite corresponds to a breaking of the symmetry that the material enjoyed at higher temperatures.
            Nucleation events cause these variants to collect into regions, that is, it is energetically favourable to group types of unit cells. Together these regions form a microstructure responsible for many macroscopic properties of the alloy including the shape memory effect. <br>
            Provided that there is a certain relation between these variants, the regions connect nicely without relative diffusion of atoms (no macroscopic deformation results from this transition).</p>
          </div>
          
        <h3>Energy Minimisation Setup</h3>
        <p>Consider a volume of interest, called the reference domain, \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) which is open, bounded, connected.
          By the Cauchy-Born rule [<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1081286507086898">10</a>], a macroscopic linear deformation \(u : \Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d\) can be applied to increase the energy density of the lattice within the reference domain to \(W(F,T) \geq 0\) where
          \(F(x):=\nabla u(x)\) is the deformation gradient matrix and \(T\geq 0\) is the temperature of the reference domain (assumed to be homogeneous).<br>
          This project covers the energy minimisation description of SMAs. The energy functional depends on the deformation gradient and the temperature, \(T\):<br></p>
          \(\hspace{3cm}E[u, T] = \int_\Omega W(\nabla u(x), T)~dx\)
        <p>As we expect the energy density, \(W\), to be non-negative, we can minimise the energy functional by taking deformation gradients within the kernel of the energy density \((~\nabla u \in K(T) := W_T^{-1}(0)~)\), and so, we need not know the exact form of \(W\).
          We will make some assumptions on the form of \(W\) [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b10191">11</a>] that will allow us to derive the "Multi-Well Inclusions" used to describe SMAs. These assumptions are the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">M1: Not performing a deformation must not increase the energy density:<br><br>
          \(\hspace{3cm} W(Id, T) = 0\).</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">M2: The energy density is invariant under a change of frame:<br><br>
          \(\hspace{3cm} W(QF, T) = W(F,T)\) for all \(Q\in SO(d)\).</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">M3: Performing symmetries of the crystal does not change the energy density:<br><br>
          \(\hspace{3cm} W(FR_i, T) = W(F, T)\)<br><br>
          for all \(R_i\) in the symmetry point group of the crystal.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">M4: Compressing or expanding the crystal lattice costs energy:<br><br>
          \(\hspace{3cm} W(\alpha\cdot Id, T) > W(Id, T)\)<br><br>
          where \(\alpha\in [0,\infty)\backslash \{1\}\) is the scaling factor of the deformation.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">M5: Infinite compression and infinite stretching both cost infinite energy:<br><br>
          \(\hspace{3cm} \text{If }\det(F)\rightarrow 0\text{ or }|F|\rightarrow\infty, \text{ then }W(F,T)\rightarrow\infty\)<br><br>
          where \(|\cdot|\) denotes the Frobenius norm on matrices.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The multi-well kernels that are core to SMAs can be derived (surppressing \(T\) in the notation) from the energy density assumptions \((M2)\) and \((M3)\). Suppose that \(F \in K\), then \(QF R_i \in K\) for
        \(Q \in SO(d)\) and \(R_i\) in the symmetry point group of the martensitic material. We denote the variants by \(U_i := F R_i\). Then we can write the
        minimising set as a finite union of “Energy Wells”:</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm} K = SO(d)U_1 \cup SO(d)U_2 \cup \cdots \cup SO(d)U_n.\)
        <p>We may assume that the variants preserve orientation, and so \(\det(U_i) > 0\) for all \(i \in [1, n]\).
        By polar decomposition we assume that the \(U_i\) are positive definite symmetric matrices (the remaining orthogonal matrix is absorbed into SO(d)).
        The differential inclusions with this minimising set are called multi-well inclusions. The general problem for modelling SMAs is as follows:</p>
          \(\hspace{3cm}\text{Solve}\hspace{.5cm}\begin{equation*}
          \left\{
          \begin{aligned}
          &u\in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^{3}),\\
          &\nabla u \in K(T).
          \end{aligned}
          \right.
          \end{equation*}\)
          \(\hspace{1cm}\text{where}\hspace{.5cm}\begin{equation*}
          K(T) := \left\{
          \begin{aligned}
          &SO(3)Id,\hspace{.5cm}\text{if \(T\) exceeds the critical temperature,}\\
          &\bigcup_{i=1}^n SO(3)U_i \hspace{.5cm}\text{if \(T\) is below the critical temperature}.
          \end{aligned}
          \right.
          \end{equation*}\)
        
        <p>Deformations, \(u\), that satisfies this inclusion must be pointwise minimisers of our
        energy functional. However, not all minimisers satisfy this differential inclusion exactly, there may be deformations that minimise the energy functional but only approximately
        satisfy the differential inclusion.</p>

        <p>For crystalline materials, we expect compact \(K\). This is a reasonable expectation due
        to large deformations of \(\Omega\) causing large energy increases (boundedness) and due to the
        expected continuity of the energy density, and because \(\{0\}\) is closed, \(K\) is also closed
        (closed). The compactness then follows from the Heine-Borel theorem applied to \(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\).
        Non-compact \(K\) also gives way to different theory [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00396">12</a>] but for the aims of this project,
        will be largely ignored.</p>

        <p>Before we return to material science and multi-well inclusions, we will introduce some mathematics that is used in proving existence of particular solutions.</p>

        <p>The direct method is used to prove existence of minimisers to functionals over a Banach space. However, this existence isn't free, the functional is required to be lower semicontinuous and coercive.

        <div class="content">
          <p>We first show that \(\mathcal{F}\) is strongly lower semicontinuous. Let \( u_j \rightarrow u\) in \(W^{1,p}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)\) and so, \(\nabla u_j \rightarrow \nabla u\) in \(L^p (\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)\).<br>
          By LINK, there exists a (non-labelled) subsequence such that \(\nabla u_j \rightarrow \nabla u\), almost everywhere in \(\Omega\). <br>
          By assumption, we have \(h(x, \nabla u_j(x)) \geq 0\). Using Fatou's lemma and \(h\) being Carathéodory,</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}\mathcal{F}[u] := \int_\Omega h(x,\nabla u(x))~dx \leq \liminf_{j\rightarrow\infty} \int_\Omega h(x,\nabla u_j(x))~dx = \liminf_{j\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal{F}[u_j].\)
          <p>Since this holds for all subsequences, it follows for the original sequence and we have strong lower semicontinuity.</p>
          <p>We now prove weak lower semicontinuity. Take \((u_j)\subset W^{1,p}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)\) with weak limit \(u\) in \(W^{1,p}\). We wish to show that</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}\mathcal{F}[u] \leq \liminf_{j\rightarrow\infty} \mathcal{F}[u_j] =: \alpha.\)
          <p>Taking a subsequence, we can assume that \(\mathcal{F}[u_j] \rightarrow \alpha\). By the Mazur lemma [LINK] we can find the convex combination</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}v_j = \sum_{n=j}^{N(j)}\theta_n^{(j)}u_n,\hspace{1cm}\text{where}\hspace{1cm}\theta_n^{(j)} \in [0,1]\text{ and }\sum_{n=j}^{N(j)}\theta_n^{(j)} = 1.\)
          <p>such that \(v_j \rightarrow u\) in \(W^{1,p}\). As \(h(x, \cdot)\) is convex for almost every \(x\),</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}\mathcal{F}[v_j] = \int_\Omega h(x, \sum_{n=j}^{N(j)}\theta_n^{(j)}\nabla u_n(x))~dx \leq \sum_{n=j}^{N(j)} \theta_n^{(j)}\mathcal{F}[u_n].\)
          <p>Since \(\mathcal{F}[u_n] \rightarrow \alpha\) as \(n\rightarrow \infty\) and \(\sum_{n=j}^{N(j)}\theta_n^{(j)} = 1\), we arrive at</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}\liminf_{j\rightarrow\infty} \mathcal{F}[v_j] \leq \alpha.\)
          <p>From the strong lower semicontinuity, and since \(v_j \rightarrow u\) strongly, we obtain \(\mathcal{F}[u] \leq \liminf_{j\rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{F}[v_j]\). The end of the proof follows.</p>

        <p>By switching to properties of the energy density, we have now steadily moved closer to a tool that can be used to study minimisers of the energy functional.
          However, with these properties, we have introduced an issue that must be addressed: There is a contradiction between the assumptions about the energy density and the convexity we wish to impose upon it.

      <!--Quasiconvexity-->
      <section>
        <h2 id="Quasi">Quasiconvexity:</h2>
        <p>The notion of quasiconvexity was first introduced in 1952 by Charles B. Morrey Jr. [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-2/issue-1/Quasi-convexity-and-the-lower-semicontinuity-of-multiple-integrals/pjm/1103051941.full">16</a>].
        It was introduced to provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the integrand for the
        functional to be weakly lower semicontinuous.</p>
        <div class="definition">
          <p><b><i>Quasiconvexity:</i></b><br>
          A locally bounded Borel measurable function \(h : \mathbb{R}^{d\times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is quasiconvex if</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}h(F) \leq \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega h(F+\nabla \psi(z))~dz\)
          <p>for all \(F \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\), all \(\psi \in W^{1,\infty}_0 (\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)\), and for a bounded Lipschitz domain \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note the physical intuition of this inequality: applying a continuously differentiable deformation, \(\psi\), to the
        interior of a region, \(\Omega\), of the crystal will expectedly increase the average internal energy of the material.</p>
        
        <p>Quasiconvexity is notoriously difficult to prove in a function. It will be useful to introduce an even weaker notion of convexity called rank-one convexity.</p>
        <p><b><i>Convexity Hierarchy:</i></b><br>
        A locally bounded Borel measurable function \(h : \mathbb{R}^{d\times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) follows the hierarchy below</p>

              <p>Take \(F\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\), \(V\in L^1(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}) \text{ with } \int_\Omega V = 0\), and define a measure,

              <p>This measure is a probability measure as it is bounded \(|\langle h, \mu \rangle| \leq \|h\|_\infty\), it has positive \(\langle h, \mu\rangle\) (\(h\) shifted to be positive), and normalises as \(\langle \mathbb{1}, \mu \rangle = 1\).
                Hence we write \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^1(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d})\). Because the barycenter of \(\mu\) is</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\left[\mu\right] = \langle Id, \mu\rangle = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega F+V(x)~dx = F,\)

              \(\hspace{2cm}h(F) = h(\langle Id, \mu\rangle) \leq \langle h\circ Id, \mu\rangle = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega h(F+V(x))~dx.\)
              <p>Setting \(V(x) := \nabla \psi\) for some \(\psi\in W^{1,\infty}_0 (\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)\), gives us the first statement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Let \(A,B\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) be rank-one connected through \(B-A=a\otimes \hat{n}\) for \(a\in\mathbb{R}^d \backslash \{0\}\) a non-zero vector and \(\hat{n}\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) a unit vector.<br>
                Let \(Q_n\) be a cube centered at the origin such that \(|Q_n| = 1\) and \(\hat{n}\) is orthogonal to a face of the cube.<br>

              \(\hspace{2cm}\phi_0 (x) := \begin{cases}

              t x - t\hspace{0.3cm}&\text{if }x\in(t, 1].
              \end{cases}\)
              <p>The constructed sequence is called a laminate in the \(\hat{n}\) direction. We define the disjoint spaces:</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\begin{align*}
              D_{j,n,0} &= \{x\in Q_n : jx\cdot\hat{n} - \lfloor jx\cdot\hat{n} \rfloor \in [0,t]\}\\
              D_{j,n,1} &= \{x\in Q_n : jx\cdot\hat{n} - \lfloor jx\cdot\hat{n} \rfloor \in (t,1]\}
              \end{align*}\)
              <p>Note that the gradient of this laminate takes on values in \(\{A,B\}\):</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\begin{align*}
              \nabla u_j \big|_{D_{j,n,0}} &= F + \nabla \left[-\frac{1}{j}(1-t)(jx\cdot\hat{n} - \lfloor jx\cdot\hat{n}\rfloor)\right]\otimes a \\ &= F - (1-t)a\otimes\hat{n} \\ &= t A + (1-t)B - (1-t)(B-A) = A,
              \end{align*}\)
              <p>and similarly, \(\nabla u_j \big|_{D_{j,n,1}} = B\). We also have \(u_j \overset{\ast}{\rightharpoonup} Fx\) in \(W^{1,\infty}\) due to \(\phi_0\) being uniformly bounded. In order to use the quasiconvexity of \(h\), we must first show that</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}u_j(x) - Fx = \frac{1}{j}\phi_0 (jx\cdot\hat{n}-\lfloor jx\cdot\hat{n} \rfloor)\)
              <p>has compact support. To achieve this, we must find a function with the properties of \(u_j\), but which has boundary values of \(Fx\). This will be done through taking a sequence of convex combinations,</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}v_{j,k}(x) = \rho_k(x) u_j(x) + (1-\rho_k(x))Fx \hspace{0.2cm}\in\hspace{.2cm} W^{1,\infty}(Q_n; \mathbb{R}^d)\)
              <p>with \((\rho_k)_k \subset C^\infty_c (Q_n; [0,1])\) such that \(\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} |Q_n \backslash \rho_k^{-1}(1)| = 0\). That is \(\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}v_{j,k} = u_j\) almost everywhere. Note that because \(\rho_k\) has compact support in \(Q_n\), \(v_{j,k}(x) = Fx\) close to the boundary \(\partial Q_n\). By the <a href="PDEs.html#Compact">Rellich-Kondrachov theorem</a>, \(W^{1,\infty}\) is embedded compactly within \(L^\infty\) and so \(u_j \overset{\ast}{\rightharpoonup}Fx\) in \(W^{1\infty} \implies u_j \rightarrow Fx\) in \(L^\infty\). It is now safe to compute the following,</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\begin{align*}
              &\nabla v_{j,k}(x) = (u_j(x)-Fx)\otimes \nabla \rho_k(x) + \rho_k(x)\nabla u_j (x) + (1-\rho_k(x))F,\\
              &\limsup_{j\rightarrow\infty}\|\nabla v_{j,k}\|_{L^\infty} \leq 0 + \|\nabla u_j\|_{L^\infty} + |F| < \infty
              \end{align*}\)
              <p>because the \(\nabla u_j\) are \(L^\infty\)-bounded. Thus, \(\|\nabla v_{j,k}\|_{L^\infty}\) is eventually bounded independent of \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) and so we take a bounded subsequence \(\|\nabla v_{j(k),k}\|_{L^\infty}\). As \(h\) is locally bounded, we can bound</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\| h(\nabla v_{j(k),k})\|_{L^\infty} + \| h(\nabla u_{j(k)})\|_{L^\infty} < L\)
              <p>where \(L>0\) is a constant. By quasiconvexity, we now conclude by the following</p>
              \(\hspace{2cm}\begin{align*}
                h(tA + (1-t)B) = h(F) &\leq \frac{1}{|Q_n|}\int_{Q_n} h(\nabla u_{j(k)})\\
                &= \int_{Q_n} h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + h(\nabla u_{j(k)}) - h(\nabla v_{j(k),k})\\
                &= \int_{Q_n} h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + \int_{Q_n\backslash\rho_k^{-1}(1)} h(\nabla u_{j(k)}) - h(\nabla v_{j(k),k})\\
                &\leq \int_{Q_n}h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + \int_{Q_n\backslash\rho_k^{-1}(1)}|h(\nabla u_{j(k)}) - h(\nabla v_{j(k),k})|\\
                &\leq \int_{Q_n} h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + L|Q_n\backslash \rho_k^{-1}(1)|\\
                &= \int_{D_{j,n,0}} h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + \int_{D_{j,n,1}} h(\nabla v_{j(k),k}) + L|Q_n\backslash \rho_k^{-1}(1)|\\
                &\rightarrow th(A) + (1-t)h(B) + 0,\hspace{0.5cm}\text{as }k\rightarrow\infty.
              \end{align*}\)

        <p>It is noteworthy that, in one dimension, both quasiconvexity and rank-one convexity reduce to convexity. It is generally unknown whether rank-one convexity is equivalent to
        quasiconvexity, but in three dimensions and higher, they are distinct [<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-royal-society-of-edinburgh-section-a-mathematics/article/abs/rankone-convexity-does-not-imply-quasiconvexity/2E0BBDE4340DDDDE863F7C365C72C555">17</a>].

        <p>This form of the direct method has it's uses but, like with convexity, imposing a p-growth bound on the integrand has its own problems with the assumptions of our material \((M1-5)\).<br>

        <p>The problem of removing the p-growth bound from the assumptions of the Morrey-Acerbi-Fusco theorem is still an open one.
          We can, however, slightly strengthen our notion of quasiconvexity to the so called polyconvexity. Introduced by Ball [23] in YEAR, this notion lies between convexity and quasiconvexity in the hierarchy.
        Polyconvexity opened up the problem of proving existence of minimisers to many real world functionals in nonlinear elasticity theory (See Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden materials [24 , 25]).</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Throughout this proof, we can make a simplification without loss of generality: Translate
          the set K = {A, B} into {A, 0}.</p>
          <p><b>\( 1)\hspace{.5cm} \) </b> For the non-rank-one connected case (rank\((A) > 1\)), we start with the exact solutions.<br>
          Consider \(u\) to have a gradient \(\nabla u = Ag\) for some function \(g : \Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\). Through
          mollification, we assume further that both \(u\) and \(g\) are sufficiently smooth.<br>
          The goal is to show that \(g\) is a constant so that \(u\) is affine. We do this through
          taking the gradient of \([\nabla u]^k_j = A^k_j g\) and remembering that \(u\) is sufficiently smooth as follows:</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm} A^k_j \partial_i g = \partial_i [\nabla u]^k_j = \partial_i \partial_j u^k = \partial_j \partial_i u^k = A^k_i \partial_j g.\hspace{1cm}(\ast)\)
          <p>If \(g\) is constant, we have that \(u\) is affine and so we are done. Suppose instead that \(g\) is not constant such that there exists a point \(x\in\Omega\) with \(\zeta(x) := \nabla g(x) \neq 0\).<br>
          Defining \(a^k (x) := A^k_j / \zeta_j(x)\) for any \(j\) such that \(\zeta_j(x) \neq 0\), which is well-defined through \((\ast)\), we can write</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm} A = a(x)\otimes \zeta(x).\)
          <p>Thus giving the contradiction \(1 < \text{rank}(A) \leq 1\); proving that \(g\) is constant. Due to \(\Omega\) being connected, we have that \(u\) is affine.</p>
          
          <P>Now that the exact solutions have been dealt with, we move onto proving rigidity for the approximate solutions. Because rank\((A) > 1\), there exists a non-zero \((2 \times 2)\)-submatrix
            determinant of \(A\) which we call \(M \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}\).<br>
          Consider the half-space of values of \(\Omega\) with \(\nabla u_j (x)\) closer to \(A\) than to \(B = 0\),</P>
          \(\hspace{2cm}D_j := \left\{ x\in\Omega : |\nabla u_j(x) - A| < \frac{1}{2}|A| \right\}.\)
          
          <p>Since dist\(( \nabla u_j , \{A, 0\}) \rightarrow 0\) in measure, \(\nabla u_j - A\mathbb{1}_{D_j} \rightarrow 0\) in measure.<br>
          Consider, further, a subsequence (not made explicit) such that \(\mathbb{1}_{D_j}\overset{\ast}{\rightharpoonup}\chi\) in \(L^\infty\). (WHY CAN WE ASSUME THIS?)<br>
          For \(w \in L^1(\Omega)\) and \(\epsilon > 0\), compute
          Z
          Ω
          (∇uj (x) − A1Dj )w dx =
          Z
          {|∇uj −A1Dj |>ε}∪{|∇uj −A1Dj |<ε}
          (∇uj (x) − A1Dj )w dx
          ≤ ∥∇uj − A1Dj ∥L∞
          Z
          {|∇uj −A1Dj |>ε}
          w dx + ε∥w∥L1
          → 0 + ε∥w∥L1 as j → ∞.
          Taking ε > 0 arbitrarily small, we get ∇uj − A1Dj
          ∗
          ⇀ 0 in L∞. We can now say
          ∇uj = (∇uj − A1Dj ) + A1Dj
          ∗
          ⇀ Aχ in L∞.
          By the weak* sequential continuity of submatrix determinants, in L∞,
          ∇uj
          ∗
          ⇀ Aχ =⇒ M (∇uj ) ∗
          ⇀ M (Aχ) = M (A)χ2.
          We also compute, similarly to above, M (∇uj ) − M (A)1Dj
          ∗
          ⇀ 0 in L∞. Now,
          M (∇uj ) = (M (∇uj ) − M (A)1Dj ) + M (A)1Dj
          ∗
          ⇀ M (A)χ.
          By uniqueness of limits, M (A)χ2 = M (A)χ and due to M (A)̸ = 0, we have that
          χ ∈ {0, 1}. Indeed, χ = 1D and ∇u = A1D for some D ⊂ Ω. Since 1Dj
          ∗
          ⇀ 1D in
          15
          L∞, for 1Ω ∈ L1
          ∥1Dj ∥2
          L2 =
          Z
          1Ω1Dj dx →
          Z
          1Ω1D dx = ∥1D∥2
          L2 .
          So ∥1Dj ∥L2 → ∥1D∥L2 which, by the Radon-Riesz property of Lp-spaces [28] gives
          the strong convergence 1Dj → 1D in L2. Hence, we have 1Dj → 1D in measure and
          so
          ∇uj = (∇uj − A1Dj ) + A1Dj → 0 + A1D = ∇u in measure.
          As the sequence uj is an approximate solution, ∇u ∈ {A, 0} almost everywhere in
          Ω and, using the exact case, we reach our result for this subsequence. This does not
          change with different subsequences as we assumed weak* convergence of the solution.</p>
          <p>2) We now have A = a ⊗ ˆn and once again assume that ∇u = Ag. Computing a
          directional derivative in a direction, v, orthogonal to ˆn,
          d
          dtu(x + tv) t=0
          = ∇u(x) · v = Ag(x) · v = [aˆnT ]vg(x) = a[ˆnT v]g(x) = 0,
          we see that u is constant in any direction orthogonal to ˆn. As Ω is assumed convex,
          g only depends on x · ˆn and we may write g(x) = h′(x · ˆn) such that
          ∇u(x) = Ah′(x · ˆn).
          Due to ∇u ∈ {A, 0}, we have h′(x · ˆn) ∈ {1, 0} and so our exact solutions are of the
          form
          u(x) = v0 + h(x · ˆn)a.
          We note that exact solutions need not be affine and so the two-gradient inclusion is
          not rigid</p>

        <p>Larger minimising sets, \(K\), such as the \(N\)-gradient inclusions have similar rigidity results:</p>

          <li><p>For \(N=4\), exact solutions maintain rigidity [T4] however, approximate solutions can now fail to be rigid.

          <li><p>And for \(N=5\), even if there are no rank-one connections, rigidity is not promised for exact or approximate solutions. This result is due to Preiss and Kirchheim [kirchheimmax].</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To study more complex problems than the N-gradient inclusions, such as the multi-well inclusions that appear in material science, we must introduce both the quasiconvex hull of \(K\) in order to analyse the rigidity of approximate solutions, and convex integration to analyse the rigidity of exact solutions.</p>

        <p>The proof will be left to~\cite[Page 195]{Rindler}.</p>

        <p><b><i>Remark:</i></b><br>
          Returning briefly to the two-gradient inclusion with \(K := \{A,B\}\) having no rank-one connections, the only measures with support in \(K\) are \(\delta_A\) and \(\delta_B\).
          Thus, all elements of \(\mathcal{M}^{qc}(K)\) are Dirac masses, and so there is approximate rigidity, indeed, \(K = K^{qc}\).
          This reasoning fails for \(K_{T_4}\). This is due to the construction of an approximate solution involving a sequence that generates a non-Dirac mass in \(\mathcal{M}^{qc}(K)\), and so \(K_{T_4}\subsetneq K_{T_4}^{qc}\) with a lack of approximate rigidity.</p>
        
        <p>To consider a lack of approximate rigidity, we must have \(K\subsetneq K^{qc}\). So we fix the deformation on the boundary by an element \(F\in K^{qc}\), and we have the differential inclusion:</p>
        \(\begin{equation}
            \begin{cases}
            u\in W_{Fx}^{1,\infty}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d),\\
            \nabla u \in K \text{ in }\Omega.
        \end{cases}\tag{DI 3}
        \end{equation}\)
        
        <p>In order to show that the quasiconvex hull is strictly larger than \(K\), and hence showing a lack of approximate rigidity, we must introduce other hulls which bound \(K^{qc}\) from below.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="ConvexInt">Convex Integration:</h2>
        <p>This is a method for finding highly irregular solutions to PDEs. It is largely useful in studying non-linear problems such as those found in geometry, fluid mechanics [34, ..., 37], and material science [38, 39]. The rough idea is to first satisfy the boundary conditions before adding small oscillations to adjust approximate solutions closer to an exact solution.<br>
          Originally, the technique was used in differential geometry to find \(C^1\) isometric embeddings for n-manifolds into \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\). This is the convex integration of Nash and Kuipers and is covered in my fluids project LINK.<br>
          In this project, we shall discuss Gromov's convex integration which is useful for solving the differential inclusions found in material science. In particular, we shall discuss the exact solutions to \((DI~3)\)</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>We begin by showing that we can approximate \(v\) as piecewise affine. If \(v \in W^{1,\infty}\) is already piecewise affine,
            then set \(v_1 := v\) and we are done. If \(v \in C^1\), we divide \(\Omega\) into \(Ω = N ∪ S∞ k=1 Ωk\) where Ωk ⊂ Ω is a sequence of open sets and |N | = 0.
            In each Ωk, we approximate v with a finitely piecewise affine map ˜vk such that for ε > 0 given in the theorem, ∥v − ˜vk∥L∞ ≤ ε2−(k+1) and ˜vk|∂Ωk = v|∂Ωk .
            As G is open and ∇v ∈ G, we may take the approximation to have gradient inside G. That is, ∇˜vk ∈ G. Continuously connecting ˜vk gives a single piecewise affine map
            v1 := P∞ k=0 ˜vk1Ωk . In both cases, we have a piecewise affine map such that ∇v1 ∈ G a.e., v1|∂Ω = v|∂Ω, ∥v − v1∥L∞ ≤ 1 2ε. (∗)
          We continue by using the piecewise affine reduction of G to K and by taking mollifications
          of our piecewise affine map to construct a sequence (vj )j that converges strongly in W 1,1
          to the solution of this differential inclusion. Let (ηδ)δ>0 be a family of mollifiers and take
          δ1 ∈ (0, ε] such that
          ∥∇v1 − ηδ1 ∗ ∇v1∥L1 ≤ 1
          2.
          We define vj ∈ W 1,∞(Ω; Rd) piecewise affine and δj inductively by use of the assumption
          that G can be piecewise affinely reduced to K. Through this assumption,
          (I) ∇vj ∈ G a.e., vj |∂Ω = v|∂Ω, ∥vj − vj−1∥L∞ ≤ 2−j δj−1
          (II) R
          Ω dist(∇vj (x), K) dx ≤ 2−j .
          By taking 0 < δj ≤ δj−1, we obtain a sequence of mollifications that are successively closer
          20
          to their piecewise affine maps
          ∥∇vj − ηδj ∗ ∇vj ∥L1 ≤ 2−j
          where we consider vj to be continuously extended to Rd. For m ≥ j,
          ∥vm − vj ∥L∞ ≤
          m−1X
          l=j
          ∥vl+1 − vl∥L∞ ≤
          m−1X
          l=j
          2−(l+1)δl ≤ δj
          ∞X
          l=j
          2−(l+1) = 2−j δj ≤ 2−j ε
          This shows that vj is a Cauchy sequence in the complete L∞-space. Hence vj has an
          L∞-limit which we call u ∈ L∞(Ω; Rd) and which, by the above, satisfies
          ∥u − v1∥L∞ ≤ 1
          2ε and ∥u − vj ∥L∞ ≤ 2−j δj . (∗∗)
          To show that our constructed sequence (vj )j converges strongly in W 1,1, we first note that
          ∥∇ηδj ∥L1 ≤ C/δj for a constant C > 0. Then
          ∥ηδj ∗ (∇u − ∇vj )∥L1 = ∥∇ηδj ∗ (u − vj )∥L1 ≤ ∥∇ηδj ∥L1 ∥u − vj ∥L∞ ≤ C
          δj
          δj
          2j → 0,
          and so
          ∥∇u − ∇vj ∥L1 ≤ ∥∇u − ηδj ∗ ∇u∥L1 + ∥ηδj ∗ (∇u − ∇vj )∥L1 + ∥ηδj ∗ ∇vj − ∇vj ∥L1
          → 0.
          Thus, vj → u in W 1,1 and by taking a (unlabeled) subsequence, ∇vj → ∇u almost
          everywhere. By (II), we have ∇u ∈ K almost everywhere. By (∗) and (∗∗) we have
          ∥u − v∥L∞ ≤ ε, and from (I), we have u|∂Ω = v|∂Ω. We have found are solution.</p>

          <p>Our aim is to show that G∞ can be piecewise affinely reduced to K. Once we have
          done this, the abstract theorem 5 gives the desired result. Without loss of generality, we
          take A ∈ G1. By (1) of the definition of In-Approximation, A ∈ Glc
          2 . Let n ∈ N and by
          Lemma 4, there exists a piecewise affine map ψ(n)
          2 ∈ W 1,∞(Ω; Rd) such that
          A + ∇ψ(n)
          2 ∈ G2 a.e., ψ(n)
          2 |∂Ω = 0, and ∥ψ(n)
          2 ∥L∞ ≤ 1
          22−1n
          22
          Again by (1) of the definition of In-Approximation, A + ∇ψ(n)
          2 ∈ Glc
          3 and we continue to
          find a sequence (ψ(n)
          k )n
          k=2 ⊂ W 1,∞
          0 (Ω; Rd) of piecewise affine functions such that
          A +
          kX
          i=2
          ∇ψ(n)
          i ∈ Gk ⊂ Glc
          k a.e., and ∥ψ(n)
          k ∥L∞ ≤ 1
          2k−1n.
          By defining the piecewise affine map
          ψn :=
          nX
          i=2
          ψ(n)
          i ∈ W 1,∞(Ω; Rd),
          we have
          A + ∇ψn ∈ Gn ⊂ G∞ a.e., and ∥ψn∥L∞ ≤
          nX
          i=2
          1
          2i−1n = 1
          n.
          We have proven statement (1) of piecewise affine reduction. Now all that remains is to
          prove

          n→∞
          Z
          Ω
          dist(A + ∇ψn, K) dx = 0.
          Since by definition of in-approximation the Gk are each uniformly bounded, dist(A +
          ∇ψn, K) is uniformly bounded. By (2) of the definition of in-approximation, limn→∞(A +
          ∇ψn) ∈ K. Thus, G∞ can be piecewise affinely reduced to K and we are done.</p>

    <section>
        <h1>Partial Differential Equations</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This page exists to review my advanced PDEs course which, unfortunately, I did poorly in for the exam. I hope that by reviewing this subject, I can address any weaknesses and go further than what my course at Warwick offered. Furthermore, many of the subjects I am interested in rely on the content below and so I will use this page as reference for those projects.
            These notes will be based on Felix Schulze's notes on elliptic PDEs; Charlie Elliott's notes which introduce Bochner spaces, parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, and on gradient flows; and possibly on Marie-Therese Wolfram's notes on applications.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Sob">Sobolev Spaces:</h2>
        <h3>Functional Analysis for PDEs</h3>
        <p>A major goal in studying PDEs is to employ the methods of functional analysis. To identify why this is desired, we shall talk about the Poisson problem:<br>
        For \(B = \mathbb{B}_1(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) and \(f\in C^\infty(B)\), solve</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}\begin{cases}
            -\Delta u = f, &\text{ on }B\\
            u = 0, &\text{ on }\partial B.
        \end{cases}\)
        <p>If we reformulate this problem as a bounded linear functional on an appropriate function space, we can use the Riesz representation theorem to prove existence of a solution. That is,</p>
        \(\hspace{1cm}f=-\Delta u \iff \int \phi f = -\int \phi\Delta u \iff \int \phi f = \int Du \cdot D\phi = (u, \phi)_{H^1_0}\)
        <p>where \(\phi\in C^\infty_c(B)\) and we have used the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations and integration by parts. By showing that the linear functional \(L(\phi) = \int f \phi\) is bounded, we can prove existence of solutions.</p>
        <p>We now aim to show boundedness of \(L\) with respect to the \(H^1_0\) norm. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:</p>
        \(\hspace{2cm}|L(\phi)| = |\int f\phi| \leq \|f\|_{L^2(B)}\|\phi\|_{L^2(B)}\)
        <p>It remains to show that there is a continuous inclusion \((C^\infty_0(B), \|\cdot\|_{H^1_0})\hookrightarrow L^2(B)\). This follows from the Poincaré discussed later.</p>
        <p>It seems we are done. However, there is a slight problem which leads us to much more mathematics. That problem is best seen if we first state the Riesz representation theorem.</p>
        <div class="theorem">
        <p><b><i>Riesz Representation Theorem:</i></b><br>
        Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space with inner product \((\cdot, \cdot)\) and consider a bounded linear functional \(L\in H^\ast\). There exists a unique \(u \in H\) s.t.</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}(u, \phi) = L(\phi), \hspace{.5cm}\text{for all }\phi\in H.\) 
        <p>The map \(L\mapsto u: H^\ast \rightarrow H\) is an isometric linear isomorphism.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>First note that a closed subspace of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert space (it is still complete). Consider the closed subspace \(\ker(L) \subset H\) and take the orthogonal decomposition \(H = \ker(L)\otimes\ker(L)^\perp\).<br>
            The space \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is at most one-dimensional. Indeed, given \(\phi,\psi\in \ker(L)^\perp\),</p>
            \(\hspace{2cm} L(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi) = 0, \text{ and so, } L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in \ker(L)\).
            <p>Because \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is a linear subspace, \(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in \ker(L)^\perp\).<br>
                Hence, \(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in ker(L)\cap\ker(L)^\perp = \{0\}\) and \(\phi,\psi\) are linearly dependent. <br>
                Due to one-dimensionality, \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is spanned by a single element \(u\in H\).<br> FINISH!</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> The space \( (C^\infty_0(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) is not complete. For example, take a cauchy sequence in \( (C^\infty_0, \|\cdot\|_{H^1_0}) \) that converges to \(x\mapsto 1-|x| \text{ in }L^2([-1,1])\).
            By the continuous inclusion imposed by Poincaré, the sequence converges within \( (C^\infty_0(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) but the limit is not in \(C^\infty_0(B)\).</p>
        <p>This problem can be addressed by taking the completion of \( (C^\infty_c(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) (called \(H^1_0\)) but this is rather abstract and can be done in an easier way.
            Once this is done, the Riesz representation theorem gives the existence of a "weak" solution which is not necessarily in \(C^2\).</p>
        
        <h3>Weak Derivatives</h3>
        <p>Weak derivatives, together with weak convergence (to be seen later), provide useful tools for dealing with averaging of solutions. This is due to their non-local behaviour - they are indeed global definitions.
          Because of these tools, they prove very useful in dealing with low-regularity (non-smooth or even non-\(C^1\)) solutions. Throughout my projects, these ideas have cropped up in Landau damping when discussing low velocity-regularity solutions and in Turbulent flows when discussing weak solutions which often model these flows.
          This is no surprise as both relate to non-linear PDEs and so one can expect complicated solutions. We discuss them on this page to build up tools for solving second-order linear (and non-linear) elliptic PDEs.<br>
          We first define the following notation: Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\). For \(u \in C^k(\Omega)\) a function and \(\alpha = (\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_d)\in\mathbb{N}^d\) a multi-index, we write</p>
        \(\hspace{2cm} D^\alpha u := \frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} u}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots\partial x_d^{\alpha_d}}\)
        <p>for \(|\alpha| \leq k\).</p>
        <div class="definition">
            <p><b><i>Definition of Weak Derivative:</i></b><br>
            Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) be open, \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) and \(\alpha\) a multi-index. We say that \(v\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) is a weak (partial) derivative of \(u\) corresponding to \(\alpha\) if</p>
            \(\hspace{3cm}\int_\Omega u D^\alpha \phi~dx = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_\Omega v \phi~dx,\)
            <p>for all \(\phi\in C^\infty_c(\Omega).\)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that such derivatives need not exist but when they do, they are unique.</p>
        <div class="lemma">
            <p><b><i>Uniqueness Lemma:</i></b><br>
            Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) be open, \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) and \(\alpha\) a multi-index.<br>
            If \(v_1,v_2\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) are both weak derivatives of u corresponding to \(\alpha\), then \(v_1 = v_2\) as an element of \(L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) (almost everywhere).</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since \(v_1 \text{ and }v_2\) are both weak derivatives of u, we use linearity to obtain</p>
            \(\hspace{3cm} \int_\Omega (v_1-v_2) \phi~dx = 0, \text{ for all }\phi\in C^\infty_c(\Omega).\)
            <p>By the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, we achieve uniqueness.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We can now denote the defined weak derivatives by \(D^\alpha u\). It is noteworthy that these derivatives are not defined at a point (like their classical counterpart), but instead are a global definition of derivative.</p>
        <p><b>Functions can be weakly differentiable, but not classically</b>.</p>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">show:</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>One such example is the function \(u:(-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) defined by \(u(x) = x\chi_{(0,1)}\) whose weak derivative can be found as follows</p>
          \(\hspace{3cm}\int_{(-1,1)} x\chi_{(0,1)}\phi'~dx = \int_{(0,1)}x\phi'~dx = -\int_{(-1,1)}\chi_{(0,1)}\phi~dx\)
          <p>So \(u\) has weak derivative \(x\mapsto\chi_{(0,1)}(x):(-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\). The classical derivative agrees with the weak derivative except at \(x=0\) where the classical derivative doesn't exist.</p>
        </div>
          
          
        <p><b>Being classically differentiable almost everywhere is insufficient for the existence of weak derivatives</b>.</p>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">show:</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Take the Heaviside step function \(H: (-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) defined by \(H(x)=\chi_{[0,1)}\) which is classically differentiable away from the origin, but has no weak derivatives.<br>
          Indeed, if such weak derivatives existed, it must agree with the classical derivative where it is defined (from the definition of weak derivative, integration by parts on the LHS, and uniqueness). However,</p>
          \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{(-1,1)}\chi_{[0,1)} \phi'~dx = \int_{[0,1)}\phi'~dx = \phi(1)-\phi(0) = -\phi(0)\\ \)
          \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{(-1,1)/\{0\}} 0\cdot\phi~dx = 0.\)
          <p>Thus, there is no weak derivative defined for all \(\phi\in C^\infty_c\).</p>

        <p><b>Continuity is neither sufficient nor necessary for existence of weak derivatives</b>.</p>


        <p>What are the conditions for weak derivatives?</p>
        <div class="lemma">
            <p><b><i>Conditions for Weak Derivatives:</i></b><br>
            Let \(d\geq 2\) and consider \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) open, and \(p\in\Omega\).
            If \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\cap C^1(\Omega \backslash \{p\})\), and \(Du\) is integrable on some neighbourhood of \(p\) in \(\Omega\),<br>
            then \(u\) is weakly differentiable on the whole of \(\Omega\).</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>We need to prove weak differentiability in an aritrary direction \(i\in \{1,\cdots, d\}\) (WLOG take the direction \(i=d\)).<br>
            Denote the projection \(\hat{x} = (x_1, \cdots, x_{d-1})\) and similarly for the point \(p\).<br>
            For each \(\hat{x}\neq\hat{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{d-1}\), the line \(L_\hat{x} = \{(\hat{x}, x_d): x_d\in\mathbb{R}\}\) doesn't pass through \(p\), by the assumptions, \(u\) is a \(C^1\) function along this line.
            Integration by parts then gives</p>
            \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{\Omega\cap L_\hat{x}} u D_d\phi~dx_d = -\int_{\Omega\cap L_\hat{x}}(D_d u) \phi~dx_d,\hspace{.5cm}\text{for all }\phi\in C^\infty_c (\Omega).\)
            <p>Integrating along the \(\hat{x}\)-direction, and using the fact that \(\{\hat{x}=\hat{p}\}\) is a null set, we arrive at the desired result (this integration requires that \(d\geq 2\)).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that this can be generalised to the situation where there is a classical derivative away from a sufficiently small set and one which is integrable across this set.</p>

        <h3>Sobolev Spaces</h3>
        <p>\(L^p\) spaces often characterise both grouped up and bounded properties of a function: \(x\mapsto \mathbb{1}_\mathbb{R} (x)\) lies in \(L^\infty \backslash L^1\ (\mathbb{R})\) (not grouped at all, but bounded) whereas \(x\mapsto\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) lies in \(L^1 \backslash L^\infty([0,1])\) (grouped around the origin, but not bounded).<br>
          Sobolev spaces, \(W^{k,p}\) generalise these \(L^p\) spaces to include the function's differentiability as an important property. For example \(x\mapsto |x|\) is in \(W^{1,p} \backslash W^{2,p}([-1,1])\) because it is only once weakly differentiable.
          Because of this additional property, and due to these spaces being Banach, these spaces are ideal for studying partial differential equations. Note that \(W^{0,p} = L^p\).</p>

            For \(\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d\) open, \(1\leq p \leq \infty\) and \(k\in\mathbb{N}\), we denote the Sobolev space \(W^{k,p}(\Omega)\) as the space of all \(L^p (\Omega)\)-functions, u,
            such that for all multi-indices \(\alpha\) such that \(|\alpha| \leq k\), the weak derivative \(D^\alpha u\) exists and lies in \(L^p(\Omega)\). The Sobolev space, \(W^{k,p}(\Omega)\) has norm

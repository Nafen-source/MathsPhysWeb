        <h1>Partial Differential Equations</h1>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>This page exists to review my advanced PDEs course which, unfortunately, I did poorly in for the exam. I hope that by reviewing this subject, I can address any weaknesses and go further than what my course at Warwick offered.
            These notes will be based on Felix Schulze's notes on elliptic PDEs; Charlie Elliott's notes which introduce Bochner spaces, parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, and on gradient flows; and possibly on Marie-Therese Wolfram's notes on applications.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Sob">Sobolev Spaces:</h2>
        <h3>Functional Analysis for PDEs</h3>
        <p>A major goal in studying PDEs is to employ the methods of functional analysis. To identify why this is desired, we shall talk about the Poisson problem:<br>
        For \(B = \mathbb{B}_1(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) and \(f\in C^\infty(B)\), solve</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}\begin{cases}
            -\Delta u = f, &\text{ on }B\\
            u = 0, &\text{ on }\partial B.
        \end{cases}\)
        <p>If we reformulate this problem as a bounded linear functional on an appropriate function space, we can use the Riesz representation theorem to prove existence of a solution. That is,</p>
        \(\hspace{1cm}f=-\Delta u \iff \int \phi f = -\int \phi\Delta u \iff \int \phi f = \int Du \cdot D\phi = (u, \phi)_{H^1_0}\)
        <p>where \(\phi\in C^\infty_c(B)\) and we have used the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations and integration by parts. By showing that the linear functional \(L(\phi) = \int f \phi\) is bounded, we can prove existence of solutions.</p>
        <p>We now aim to show boundedness of \(L\) with respect to the \(H^1_0\) norm. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:</p>
        \(\hspace{2cm}|L(\phi)| = |\int f\phi| \leq \|f\|_{L^2(B)}\|\phi\|_{L^2(B)}\)
        <p>It remains to show that there is a continuous inclusion \((C^\infty_0(B), \|\cdot\|_{H^1_0})\hookrightarrow L^2(B)\). This follows from the Poincaré discussed later.</p>
        <p>It seems we are done. However, there is a slight problem which leads us to much more mathematics. That problem is best seen if we first state the Riesz representation theorem.</p>
        <div class="theorem">
        <p><b><i>Riesz Representation Theorem:</i></b><br>
        Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space with inner product \((\cdot, \cdot)\) and consider a bounded linear functional \(L\in H^\ast\). There exists a unique \(u \in H\) s.t.</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}(u, \phi) = L(\phi), \hspace{.5cm}\text{for all }\phi\in H.\) 
        <p>The map \(L\mapsto u: H^\ast \rightarrow H\) is an isometric linear isomorphism.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>First note that a closed subspace of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert space (it is still complete). Consider the closed subspace \(\ker(L) \subset H\) and take the orthogonal decomposition \(H = \ker(L)\otimes\ker(L)^\perp\).<br>
            The space \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is at most one-dimensional. Indeed, given \(\phi,\psi\in \ker(L)^\perp\),</p>
            \(\hspace{2cm} L(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi) = 0, \text{ and so, } L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in \ker(L)\).
            <p>Because \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is a linear subspace, \(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in \ker(L)^\perp\).<br>
                Hence, \(L(\phi)\psi - L(\psi)\phi \in ker(L)\cap\ker(L)^\perp = \{0\}\) and \(\phi,\psi\) are linearly dependent. <br>
                Due to one-dimensionality, \(\ker(L)^\perp\) is spanned by a single element \(u\in H\).<br> FINISH!</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> The space \( (C^\infty_0(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) is not complete. For example, take a cauchy sequence in \( (C^\infty_0, \|\cdot\|_{H^1_0}) \) that converges to \(x\mapsto 1-|x| \text{ in }L^2([-1,1])\).
            By the continuous inclusion imposed by Poincaré, the sequence converges within \( (C^\infty_0(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) but the limit is not in \(C^\infty_0(B)\).</p>
        <p>This problem can be addressed by taking the completion of \( (C^\infty_c(B), \| \cdot \|_{H^1_0}) \) (called \(H^1_0\)) but this is rather abstract and can be done in an easier way.
            Once this is done, the Riesz representation theorem gives the existence of a "weak" solution which is not necessarily in \(C^2\).</p>
        
        <h3>Weak Derivatives</h3>
        <div class="definition">
            <p><b><i>Definition of Weak Derivative:</i></b><br>
            Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) be open, \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) and \(\alpha\) a multi-index. We say that \(v\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) is a weak (partial) derivative of \(u\) corresponding to \(\alpha\) if</p>
            \(\hspace{3cm}\int_\Omega u D^\alpha \phi~dx = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_\Omega v \phi~dx,\)
            <p>for all \(\phi\in C^\infty_c(\Omega).\)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that such derivatives need not exist but when they do, they are unique.</p>
        <div class="lemma">
            <p><b><i>Uniqueness Lemma:</i></b><br>
            Let \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) be open, \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) and \(\alpha\) a multi-index.<br>
            If \(v_1,v_2\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) are both weak derivatives of u corresponding to \(\alpha\), then \(v_1 = v_2\) as an element of \(L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\) (almost everywhere).</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since \(v_1 \text{ and }v_2\) are both weak derivatives of u, we use linearity to obtain</p>
            \(\hspace{3cm} \int_\Omega (v_1-v_2) \phi~dx = 0, \text{ for all }\phi\in C^\infty_c(\Omega).\)
            <p>By the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, we achieve uniqueness.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We can now denote the defined weak derivatives by \(D^\alpha u\). It is noteworthy that these derivatives are not defined at a point (like their classical counterpart), but instead are a global definition of derivative.</p>
        <p><b>Functions can be weakly differentiable, but not classically</b>. One such example is the function \(u:(-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) defined by \(u(x) = x\chi_{(0,1)}\) whose weak derivative can be found as follows</p>
        \(\hspace{3cm}\int_{(-1,1)} x\chi_{(0,1)}\phi'~dx = \int_{(0,1)}x\phi'~dx = -\int_{(-1,1)}\chi_{(0,1)}\phi~dx\)
        <p>So \(u\) has weak derivative \(x\mapsto\chi_{(0,1)}(x):(-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\). The classical derivative agrees with the weak derivative except at \(x=0\) where the classical derivative doesn't exist.</p>
        <p><b>The condition of being classical differentiable almost everywhere is insufficient for the existence of weak derivatives</b>. Take the Heaviside step function \(H: (-1,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) defined by \(H(x)=\chi_{[0,1)}\) which is classically differentiable away from the origin, but has no weak derivatives.<br>
            Indeed, if such weak derivatives existed, it must agree with the classical derivative where it is defined (from the definition of weak derivative, integration by parts on the LHS, and uniqueness). However,</p>
        \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{(-1,1)}\chi_{[0,1)} \phi'~dx = \int_{[0,1)}\phi'~dx = \phi(1)-\phi(0) = -\phi(0)\)
        \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{(-1,1)/\{0\}} 0\cdot\phi~dx = 0.\)
        <p>Thus, there is no weak derivative defined for all \(\phi\in C^\infty_c\).</p>
        <p><b>Continuity is neither sufficient nor necessary for existence of weak derivatives</b>.</p>


        <p>What are the conditions for weak derivatives?</p>
        <div class="lemma">
            <p><b><i>Conditions for Weak Derivatives:</i></b><br>
            Let \(d\geq 2\) and consider \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d\) open, and \(p\in\Omega\).
            If \(u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)\cap C^1(\Omega \backslash \{p\})\), and \(Du\) is integrable on some neighbourhood of \(p\) in \(\Omega\),<br>
            then \(u\) is weakly differentiable on the whole of \(\Omega\).</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" style="border: black solid 1px;" class="collapsible">proof:</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>We need to prove weak differentiability in an aritrary direction \(i\in \{1,\cdots, d\}\) (WLOG take the direction \(i=d\)).<br>
            Denote the projection \(\hat{x} = (x_1, \cdots, x_{d-1})\) and similarly for the point \(p\).<br>
            For each \(\hat{x}\neq\hat{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{d-1}\), the line \(L_\hat{x} = \{(\hat{x}, x_d): x_d\in\mathbb{R}\}\) doesn't pass through \(p\), by the assumptions, \(u\) is a \(C^1\) function along this line.
            Integration by parts then gives</p>
            \(\hspace{2cm}\int_{\Omega\cap L_\hat{x}} u D_d\phi~dx_d = -\int_{\Omega\cap L_\hat{x}}(D_d u) \phi~dx_d,\hspace{.5cm}\text{for all }\phi\in C^\infty_c (\Omega).\)
            <p>Integrating along the \(\hat{x}\)-direction, and using the fact that \(\{\hat{x}=\hat{p}\}\) is a null set, we arrive at the desired result (this integration requires that \(d\geq 2\)).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that this can be generalised to the situation where there is a classical derivative away from a sufficiently small set and one which is integrable across this set.</p>
